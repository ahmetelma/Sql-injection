# Sql-injection,
project name:
database breakthrough;
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a computer language for managing databases. This includes discovering data quickly, updating it, and deleting it. Several websites, such as e-commerce sites and investment firms, have large databases that store information about millions of customers, and they manage such databases using SQL.
Because the primary goal of this assault is to get access to the system's database, the repercussions of this attack can be quite damaging.
SQL injection is a type of code injection that has the potential to seriously damage your database.
SQL injection is amongst one the top frequent web hacking tactics.
SQL injection is that when malicious software is injected into SQL statements through web page inputs.
 SQL injection with Web Pages,
, SQL injection take place, whenever you request a user for information, such as his username/use id, but rather than a name/id, the user provides you a SQL statement that you unintentionally perform in your database
History 
During 1998, the very first published discussions regarding SQL injection began to appear; for instance, 1998 article in Phrack Magazine.
Form,
The Open web Application Security Project named SQL injection (SQLI) as one of the top ten web application vulnerabilities in 2007 and 2010.   On the OWASP top ten list in 2013, SQLI was ranked number one.  SQL injection can be divided into four types:
Classic SQLI
Blind or Inference SQL injection
Database management system-specific SQLI
Compounded SQLI
SQL injection + insufficient authentication
SQL injection + DDoS attacks
SQL injection + DNS hijacking
SQL injection + XSS
Characteristics of an SQL injection attack;
By integrating user input to SQL queries, SQL injection attacks seek to leverage web application vulnerabilities. If effective, those attacks can use the legitimate web application connection to run malicious SQL instructions. SQL injection attacks can be difficult to detect since specific steps of an attack, when evaluated apart from the others, may appear to be legitimate.
Risk Factors
The platform affected can be:
•	Language: SQL
•	Platform: Any (requires interaction with a SQL database)
Prerequisites;
basic SQL and PHP.
